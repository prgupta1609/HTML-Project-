## 🖼️ Issue

> The profile image is not rendering correctly because the image source is either incorrect or the image file isn't available in the same folder.  
To fix it:
1. Make sure the image (e.g., `profile.jpg`) exists in the same directory as `form.html`.
2. Update the image tag:
   ```html
   <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Priya Profile" width="150">
